# ToyRobot
My approach to solved a test I received from a big company:

Its a try to develop a console like a CLI application. Try to use typed objects instead strings in every places. For a more complex command book, I think could be better use a dictionary of Command class objects, with a command name as string key instead using a simple enum to validate command keywords.

It take 10 or 12 hours over 3 or 4 days. Including analysis, testing and prepare a deployment package. Not too much focused.

I write and brief analysis document in no very formal way. Also the sample provide its own help usign the "HELP" command.
